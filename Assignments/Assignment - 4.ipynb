    "Decision trees are insensitive to the order of the features, which means that permuting the values of any feature or reordering the features themselves will not affect the resulting tree or its predictions. Decision trees can be used for both classification and regression problems. They can handle missing values through various techniques, such as imputation or splitting the data based on available values. The prediction accuracy of decision trees depends on the data and the problem at hand, so it may not always be higher than other machine learning algorithms.\n",

    "Explanation:\n",
    "Pruning is a technique used in decision trees to reduce their complexity and prevent overfitting. Overfitting occurs when the tree captures noise or random fluctuations in the training data, resulting in poor generalization to new, unseen data. Pruning involves removing unnecessary branches or nodes from the tree, simplifying its structure and reducing the chances of overfitting. Pruning does not directly remove irrelevant features from the dataset, but it helps in reducing the complexity of the tree, making it more interpretable. -->"

A low entropy value indicates that the examples within a node are predominantly of the same class, while a high entropy value suggests a more diverse distribution of class labels. Decision trees use entropy (or other impurity measures like Gini index) to determine the optimal split points that maximize the information gain during the tree construction process. -->"

Outliers are extreme values that differ significantly from other data points and can have a significant impact on the split decisions made by a decision tree. Outliers can lead to the creation of suboptimal splits and potentially affect the overall performance of the tree. Decision trees are generally not computationally expensive compared to some other algorithms, can handle categorical features, and can automatically determine the optimal hyperparameters without requiring manual tuning. -->"

Information gain measures the reduction in entropy (or impurity) achieved by splitting on a particular feature. It quantifies the amount of information gained about the class labels after the split. Gain ratio adjusts information gain by taking into account the intrinsic information of the feature itself, preventing biases towards features with a large number of distinct values. Maximum likelihood estimation is a statistical technique used for parameter estimation, mean squared error is a loss function commonly used in regression problems, and Pearson correlation coefficient measures the linear relationship between two variables but is not directly used for feature selection in decision trees. -->"

By adjusting the value of C, one can control the bias-variance trade-off in the SVM model.
