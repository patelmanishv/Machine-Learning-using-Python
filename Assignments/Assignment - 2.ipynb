    "1. Solution: d) Multicollinearity is not a key assumption of linear regression. It is a potential issue that can arise when predictor variables are highly correlated with each other.\n",
    "2. Solution: b) The coefficient of determination (R-squared) measures the proportion of the variability in the response variable that is explained by the predictor variable.\n",
    "3. Solution: c) Fitted values are the values predicted by the regression model, while residuals are the differences between the actual and predicted values of the response variable.\n",
    "4. Solution: d) The VIF (Variance Inflation Factor) is used to measure the amount of multicollinearity in the predictor variables.\n",

    "7. Solution: c) The standard error of the estimate (SEE) is used\n",
    "8. Solution: d) The adjusted R-squared is used to adjust for the number of predictor variables in the model. It takes into account the number of predictors and penalizes the R-squared value if there are too many predictors that do not contribute significantly to the model.\n",
    "9. Solution: d) The residual plot is used to visualize the distribution of the residuals. It helps to check whether the assumptions of linear regression are met, such as the normality of the residuals, constant variance, and independence.\n",
